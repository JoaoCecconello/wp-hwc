<h1 align="center">WordPress Hacked Website Cleaner</h1>
<p>
    This script was created with one intention: help people to clean their WordPress website, even if it's just a little. It actually does not clean the website, it recreates the entire WordPress structure in a new folder. This is the most simple and fast way to solve the hacking and remove malicious files as I'm concerned.

    Working in a website hosting company wich the main product is focused in WordPress for 2+ years made me realize that many people don't clean their websites as they should. The main reason is basically because they do not know how to do it and just a few percentage of developers and wordpress experts know how to solve the problems that a hacked website has.

    I'm still working on it so, if you use it and have any trouble, you can report to me or suggest any changes. I'm doing it as I can =)
